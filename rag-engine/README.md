# RAG Generative AI Project

This project is a backend API that leverages MongoDB Atlas, Node.js, OpenAI, and
LlamaIndex to implement a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model for image
analysis. The API allows users to upload images, populate a MongoDB database,
and create embeddings for improved search and retrieval in a Generative AI
setup.

## Features

-   **Database Population**: Populate the MongoDB database with data for the RAG
    model.
-   **Embeddings Creation**: Generate embeddings for efficient data retrieval
    and integration with OpenAI.
-   **Image Analysis**: Analyze images based on user skin types.

## Technologies Used

-   **Express**: Web application framework for NodeJS
-   **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud database to store the raw and vector data
-   **OpenAI API**: For generating embeddings and other generative AI tasks
-   **LlamaIndex**: To handle data indexing and retrieval, aiding the RAG model

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+)
-   MongoDB Atlas account
-   OpenAI API Key
-   LlamaIndex setup (follow LlamaIndex documentation if required)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:brunaclacerda/GenAI-Lab.git
    cd GenAI-Lab/rag-engine
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables (see below).

4. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Environment Variables

Rename the file `/config/.example.env` to `.env`, and configure your environment
variables.

## Endpoints

### `/upload-data`

-   **Method**: `POST`
-   **Description**: Populates the MongoDB database with data required for the
    RAG model.

### `/generate-embeddings`

-   **Method**: `POST`
-   **Description**: Creates embeddings for the data in the database to support
    efficient search and retrieval for the RAG model.

### `/image-analysis`

-   **Method**: `POST`
-   **Description**: Accepts an uploaded image file containing a photo of a
    skincare product's ingredient list. Analyzes the ingredients in the image
    based on the specified skin type. An example image can be found at
    `/data/product.png`.
-   **Request Body**:
    -   `image` (file): The image file containing the ingredient list.
    -   `skinType` (optional, string): The user's skin type (e.g., `"oily"`).
        Defaults to `"oily"` if not specified.
-   **Response**: Returns analysis results for the uploaded ingredient list.

## Usage

To use the API, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Server**  
   Start the server using the command below. Ensure MongoDB Atlas, OpenAI, and
   LlamaIndex are configured as described in the
   [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

To use the API, follow these steps:

1.  **Start the Server**  
    Start the server using the command below. Ensure MongoDB Atlas, OpenAI, and
    LlamaIndex are configured as described in the
    [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.

    ```bash
    npm start

    ```

2.  **Populate the Database** Initialize or refresh the MongoDB database with
    necessary data for the RAG model by sending a POST request to /upload-data.

        Endpoint: /upload-data
        Method: POST

3.  **Generate Embeddings** To create embeddings for data retrieval, send a POST
    request to the /generate-embeddings endpoint. This step is required to
    support the RAG model's efficient data retrieval.

        Endpoint: /generate-embeddings
        Method: POST

4.  **Upload an Image for Analysis** Send a POST request to the /image-analysis
    endpoint. This endpoint accepts an image file containing the ingredient list
    of a skincare product and analyzes it based on the specified skin type.
    Endpoint: /image-analysis Method: POST Request: image (file): The ingredient
    list image. skinType (optional, string): Specify the userâ€™s skin type (e.g.,
    "dry", "oily"). Defaults to "oily" if not provided.
